U.S. custom keyboard layout README.txt
======================================

Installation
============

1. Drag the files UScustom.keylayout and UScustom.icns to either one
of /Library/Keyboard Layouts/ or to ~/Library/Keyboard Layouts/.

2. Log out and log in again to complete the installation.

3. In the International section of the System Preferences, you can
now select "U.S. custom" for the Input Menu. It is now available from
in the menu bar at the top right margin of the screen.


Editing the keyboard layout
===========================

If you wish to edit the keyboard layout, I recommend using
TextWrangler, a powerful free (but not open) text editor of Bare
Bones Software: <http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/>

You may use Ukelele, the free SIL Mac OS X Keyboard Layout Editor,
for viewing the U.S. custom keyboard layout and for pre-validating
any changes you have made. Do not use Ukelele for editing; it will
mess up the keyboard layout. I guess that is because this keyboard
layout is too complex for Ukelele.
